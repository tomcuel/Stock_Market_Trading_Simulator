// Length-prefixed ("framed") socket I/O: applies the lesson from Test_Functionnalities/Sockets/Socket_Size directly:
// a naive delimiter-terminated read (scan for a marker string) either times out or misreads on large/odd payloads, and offers no defense against a peer that never sends the delimiter
// Every message here is instead sent as an 8-byte big-endian length header followed by exactly that many payload bytes, so the receiver always knows exactly how much to read and can bound its allocation up front
//
// This is transport plumbing only: it has no idea what a "command" or "order" is, and is used identically by the server and every client (interactive, scripted, or bot)
